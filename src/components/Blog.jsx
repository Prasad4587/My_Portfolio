            <h2>My Thoughts & Writings</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm <strong>Tejas</strong>, a passionate and self-motivated developer exploring the exciting world of web and software development.
                I started my journey with programming languages like <strong>C++, Python, and Java</strong>, which helped me build a strong foundation in logic and object-oriented programming.
                One of my key projects, <strong>Campus Cuisine Cashier (CCC)</strong>, is a system that simplifies food ordering and billing in college canteens using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm learning <strong>React</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> to expand my skills in modern frontend frameworks and backend development.
                I'm passionate about building real-world solutions, improving user experience, and continuously growing through hands-on projects.
                Stay tuned I'll soon be sharing more blog posts about my journey and the tech I explore!
